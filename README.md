# big-mart-sales-prediction
This is one of the most famous data sets available to predict which locations produce the most sales.I have explored features that can drive sales in a supermarket such as: Outlet_Type,Outlet_Size,Item_Identifier,Item_Weight,Item_Fat_Content,Item_Visibility,Item_Type,Item_MRP,Outlet_Identifier and Outlet_Establishment_Year.
I have built a Linear regression model that predicts the sales and is saved in a csv file.


The step i followed were:

1.Loading the packages

2.Looking at the dimensions and summary

3.Univariate analysis

4.bivariate analysis

5.Dealing with missing values

6.Feature enginnering

7.Model building

8.Prediction
