# big-mart-sales-prediction
This is one of the most famous data sets available to predict which locations produce the most sales.I have explored features that can drive sales in a supermarket such as Outlet Type,Outlet Size,Item_Identifier,Item_Weight,Item_Fat_Content,Item_Visibility,Item_Type,Item_MRP,Outlet_Identifier and Outlet_Establishment_Year.
I have built a Linear regression model that predicts the sales and is saved in a csv file.


The step i followed were:
1.Loading the packages
2.Looking at the dimensions and summary
3.Univeriate analysis
4.bivariate analysis
5.Dealing with missing values
6.Feature enginnering
7.Model building
8.Prediction
